# APIs

## [USGS Earthquake Catalog](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/fdsnws/event/1/)

🚫Replace text below with a description of the API

Water's like me. It's laaazy ... Boy, it always looks for the easiest way to do things A little happy sunlight shining through there. Let all these little things happen. Don't fight them. Learn to use them. Even the worst thing we can do here is good.

## [MapBox Search Service](https://docs.mapbox.com/api/search/)

🚫Replace text below with a description of the API

This is the way you take out your flustrations. Get away from those little Christmas tree things we used to make in school. Isn't it fantastic that you can change your mind and create all these happy things? Everything's not great in life, but we can still find beauty in it.

## [MapBox Maps Service](https://docs.mapbox.com/api/maps/)

🚫Replace text below with a description of the API

You can do anything your heart can imagine. In life you need colors. This is where you take out all your hostilities and frustrations. It's better than kicking the puppy dog around and all that so. I'm sort of a softy, I couldn't shoot Bambi except with a camera. Trees get lonely too, so we'll give him a little friend. We'll lay all these little funky little things in there.

## [Twilio SMS](https://www.twilio.com/docs/sms)

🚫Replace text below with a description of the API

When you do it your way you can go anywhere you choose. Let your heart take you to wherever you want to be. If I paint something, I don't want to have to explain what it is. A tree needs to be your friend if you're going to paint him. That's a son of a gun of a cloud. Even the worst thing we can do here is good.

# ️Environment Variables

In order for the app to function correctly, the user must set up their own environment variables. There should be a .env file containing the following:

    *  REACT_APP_MAP_API_TOKEN - this is your MapBox API Token, which can be found in the MapBox Account card on the trello board.

# ️Content Licenses

🚫For all content - images, icons, etc, use this table to document permission of use. Remove the two placeholders and add you content to this table
