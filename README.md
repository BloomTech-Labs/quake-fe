## APIs Used

### [USGS Earthquake Catalog](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/fdsnws/event/1/)

- The USGS Earthquake Catalog API allows for custom searches for earthquake information using a variety of parameters.

### [MapBox Search Service](https://docs.mapbox.com/api/search/)

- The Mapbox web services APIs allow you to programmatically access Mapbox tools and services. You can use these APIs to retrieve information about your account, upload and change resources, use core Mapbox tools, and more.

### [MapBox Maps Service](https://docs.mapbox.com/api/maps/)

- The Mapbox web services APIs allow you to programmatically access Mapbox tools and services. You can use these APIs to retrieve information about your account, upload and change resources, use core Mapbox tools, and more.

### [Twilio SMS](https://www.twilio.com/docs/sms)

üö´Replace text below with a description of the API

When you do it your way you can go anywhere you choose. Let your heart take you to wherever you want to be. If I paint something, I don't want to have to explain what it is. A tree needs to be your friend if you're going to paint him. That's a son of a gun of a cloud. Even the worst thing we can do here is good.

## Ô∏èEnvironment Variables

In order for the app to function correctly, the user must set up their own environment variables. There should be a .env file containing the following:

    * REACT_APP_MAP_API_TOKEN - MapBox Maps Service API Token.
      - This is needed to enable access to MapBox's geocoding and map rendering service.
      - This token can be found in the MapBox Account card on the trello board.
      
    * REACT_APP_MAP_STYLE_TOKEN - MapBox Map Style Token.
      - This is needed to style the 2D map provided through MapBox.
      - This token can be found in the MapBox Account card on the trello board.
